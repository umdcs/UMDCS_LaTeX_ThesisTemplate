\chapter{Results}
\label{chap:results}

Your results.  The idea of my thesis worked out great.  Here's a plot to show how great it worked.  

Sometimes, the TODO macro will be helpful for you to mark places where you still need to edit, or work on the document.  You'll want to remove the TODOs, of course, before submitting your thesis.
\TODO{Need to get results!!!! Make sure to finish this!}

% another figure, and this time we include an image from the images folder in this
% project.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/goodData.png}
\caption{Good data.}
\label{fig:goodData}
\end{figure} 

We can reference the plot in Figure~\ref{fig:goodData}. Also, it's sometimes nice to include tables.

% tables are often useful!
\begin{table}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ | l | l | l | }
    \hline
    Variable & Condition 1 & Condition 2 \\ \hline
    \(arc\) & 1.796 & 0.304 \\ \hline 
    \(boo\) & 3.112 & 0.411 \\ \hline 
    \(gar\) & 4.344 & 0.629 \\ 
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Illustrates the relationship between variables and the related experiment conditions.}
