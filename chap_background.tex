\section{Background}

In this work, we investigate human computer interaction. 

\subsection{Robot Interfaces}

In seminar today, we looked for papers on the ACM Digital Library. The
following paper is about virtual reality \parencite{Kreylos:2006:ESW:1128923.1128948}, whereas this paper investigates robotics issues \parencite{Drascic89}.

\section{Previous Work}

Previous work by Ranga in this area focused on measurement of peer to peer systems and found that .... ~\parencite{ranga15}. This thesis will build upon Ranga's work by exploring how the peer's network connection to the backbone routers may affect the number of clients that are able to share information..

A new article showed that utilization is.... \parencite{Abbasi:2013:DBS:2507924.2507961}. Deep learning is everywhere \parencite{Tang:2019:MTR:3365594.3358696}.

You might find yourself citing websites too: \cite{website1}.
