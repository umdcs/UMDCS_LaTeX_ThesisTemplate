% Uses new biblatex system rather than traditional bibtex
% This uses the Author-Year style for both citations and references
\usepackage[style=authoryear, citestyle=authoryear, backref=true, isbn=true, url=true, backend=biber]{biblatex}

% There doesn't seem to much different if you use the apa style in the same way
% \usepackage[style=apa, citestyle=apa, backref=true, isbn=true, url=true, backend=biber]{biblatex}

% allows the Table of Contents to include the figure listings.
\usepackage{tocbibind}
% changes the name from Bibliography to References which is more appropriate for CS
\DefineBibliographyStrings{english}{%

% Your references are placed into the .bib file and then specified here:

    % The frontmatter is all the boilerplate pages that are needed 
    % for the thesis
	\frontmatter 
 
    % You could save some space when initially printing (if you
	% really need to) by uncommenting this line to single
	% space
    %
    % \singlespace
      
    % Ideally the Introduction to your thesis.  You will want to edit the
    % cahp_intro.tex file and it will be included here.
	\include{chap_intro} 
	 
    % Any background necessary to understand your thesis.  This 
    % can also contain the related work too.  You'll want to edit the
    % chap_background.tex file and it will be included.
	\include{chap_background} 
 
    % If you feel you need or want a separate chapter for related work, or
    % just a file to contain it, you can edit the chap_relatedwork.tex file
    % as well.  And, then uncomment the line below.
	% \include{chap_relatedwork}     

    % The major content for your thesis!  What did you do and how   
    % did you do it!  Edit the chap_implementation.tex file.
	\include{chap_implementation}  

    % It's always good to have a results chapter so you can 
    % present how well your ideas and implementations worked.  The
    % file chap_results.tex is the one to edit for this.
	\include{chap_results}

    % Time to wrap up the thesis with a discussion of your ideas
    % and knowledge that you generated, along with any important
    % insights, or things you learned.  You can include ideas for
    % future extensions and effort here too.
	\include{chap_conclusion}
	
    % And finally, don't forget the references and bibliography.
    % You can add entries to the file UMDCS_Thesis.bib for your
    % references.  You then need to ``cite'' them in the tex files
    % by using the ~\cite{ReferenceID} tags.
    %
    % and make sure to include the bib in the TOC, which is
    % included below already with the heading=bibintoc option.
	\newpage
    \printbibliography[heading=bibintoc]
	
    % If you need an appendix (or appendices), they can be added here 
    % See the appendix.tex file for some more info.
	\include{appendix}
