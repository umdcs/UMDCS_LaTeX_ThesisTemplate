% At the time of this update, the website:
% http://www.olivierverdier.com/posts/2013/07/15/modern-latex/ had
% useful information for Modern LaTeX... some of it is included here.

% Uses new biblatex system rather than traditional bibtex
% This uses the Author-Year style for both citations and references
\usepackage[style=authoryear, citestyle=authoryear, backref=true, isbn=true, url=true, backend=biber]{biblatex}

% There doesn't seem to much different if you use the apa style in the same way
% \usepackage[style=apa, citestyle=apa, backref=true, isbn=true, url=true, backend=biber]{biblatex}

% allows the Table of Contents to include the figure listings.
\usepackage{tocbibind}
% changes the name from Bibliography to References which is more appropriate for CS

% Your references are placed into the .bib file and then specified here:

        % by using the ~\cite{ReferenceID} tags.
