\chapter{Implementation}

\section{First section}

You may need a nice figure, which you can algorithmically render using the Tikz package. You should really check out the Texample web site where several nice tikz examples are provided (http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/all/).

% this is how you include figures and this happens to include a tikzpicture which
% is a programming language for generating diagrams and other useful items.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}

\def \n {5}
\def \radius {3cm}
\def \margin {8} % margin in angles, depends on the radius

\foreach \s in {1,...,\n}
{
  \node[draw, circle] at ({360/\n * (\s - 1)}:\radius) {$\s$};
  \draw[->, >=latex] ({360/\n * (\s - 1)+\margin}:\radius) 
    arc ({360/\n * (\s - 1)+\margin}:{360/\n * (\s)-\margin}:\radius);
}
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Clear and concise figure captions are important to write. This one illustrates the cycle of a graph.}

\end{figure}

\section{Initial Section}

Itemized lists are often used:
\begin{itemize}
\item What language the project was coded in?
\item What is the question the urban planners want solved?
\end{itemize}
 
Math is really nice with \LaTeX too!  Wonder what the following equation can say about the world?

\[L_{s}(\vec{k_{o}}) = L_{e}(\vec{k_{o}}) \int_{\text{all $\vec{k_{i}}$}} \rho(\vec{k}_i,\vec{k}_o) L_f(\vec{k}_i) \cos\theta_i d\sigma_i \]

Enumerated lists are helpful too
\begin{enumerate}
\item Step 1
\item Step 2
\item Step 3
\begin{itemize}
\item Important part of Step 3
\item Another important part of Step 3
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

A graph rendered with the Tikz package is shown in \autoref{fig:tikzexample}.

\section{New Section For Next Important Topic}

\subsection{Algorithm Initialization}
\subsection{Atomic Operations}

You may even need code in your thesis. Here is a way to nicely include code with the \textit{listings} package in \LaTeX:
{\singlespace
\begin{lstlisting}
for (unsigned int idx=0; idx<maxSize; idx++) {
  atomic_add( idx );
}
\end{lstlisting}
}
If you need to modify some of the style of the listings package for this template, you may want to check the class style file included with this template: \textit{umdthesis.cls}.
